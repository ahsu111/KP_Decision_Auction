To do list: 

1.	The order of the sampling task and the KS decision making task will be randomized in the inpute .txt file. 
2.	The dots in the sampling task will be displayed for 300ms (0.3s) and then disappear. And then the participants will have unlimited time to choose the left/right black box with left and right arrow keys, then go to next scene right after they have made the decision.
3.	For the sampling task, it will also have 8 blocks, with four of them having feedback (Right/wrong) after each trial, and four without feedback info. The order of these 8 blocks will be randomized. 
4.	The number of dots displayed in the left/right box is also predetermined in the .txt file.  
5.	Fix the randomization of the initial button in the Likert Scale.
